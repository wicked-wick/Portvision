# Portvision
Super fast Portscanner
This tool is created keeping CTFs as the main focus.
The tool just needs a IP address or a domain name and it will find all the open ports under 1000.
We are interested in top 1000 ports because they are of utmost importance.

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/wicked-wick/Portvision.git

chmod 777 fast.py

Usage:

python3 fast.py --help(for help)

python3 fast.py -H<target>

I'll be soon updating it with a service version too, bye:)
