# Portvision
Super fast Portscanner
This tool is created keeping CTFs as the main focus.
We can just specify the ip address or the domain and it will find all the open ports under 1000.
WE are interested in top 1000 ports because they are the main focus in almost every hacking challenge.

Installation:
git clone https://github.com/wicked-wick/Portvision.git
chmod 777 fast.py

Usage:
python3 fast.py --help(for help)
python3 fast.py -H <target>

I'll be soon updating it with a service version too, bye:)
